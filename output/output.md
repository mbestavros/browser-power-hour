# How to use produced output

After running the benchmark, you should see a number of image files in `.png` format, as well as a file called `batterystats.txt` and `bugreport.zip`.

The images should be screenshots of each Speedometer run, and include the name of the tested browser. Have a look at them if you'd like performance numbers.

You may also upload `bugreport.zip` to the Android Battery Historian tool, and use it to analyze power consumption.
